They collectively define sunlight as &quot;that which makes a computer monitor difficult to see&quot; and free time as &quot;when we get to <i>play</i> games instead of make them.&quot; </span></p>

								Gabe held a number of positions in the Systems, Applications, and Advanced Technology divisions during his 13 years at Microsoft. His responsibilities included running program management for the first two releases of Windows, starting the company's multimedia division, and, most recently, leading the company's efforts on the Information Highway PC. His most significant contribution to <i>Half-Life</i> was his statement &quot;C'mon, people, you can't show the player a really big bomb and not let them blow it up.&quot;<br>

								<b><a href="mailto:%20tedb@valvesoftware.com">Ted Backman</a></b><b> - Art Director/Conceptual Artist/Illustrator/Animator</b><br>

								Kelly did all of the music and sound effects for <i>Half-Life</i> and wrote sound code to create character speech and DSP reverb effects. He spent last summer and fall working primarily on <i>Half-Life</i> game design. (Translation: spent 6 months in a big, trashed corner office, all day &amp; night with Guthrie, Casali &amp; Riller eating bad food, making bad jokes, working out tons-o-puzzles, and never, ever seeing the sun. It was great.) There is a vicious rumor that at one time he was an engineering manager at &quot;a large software company in the Pacific Northwest.&quot; However, he has long since had the Borg implants removed, and is feeling just fine now.<br>

Playing drums and percussion steadily for about 6 years, he quickly tired of all the travel. His music career brought him to California where he ended up going back to school to study Engineering and Computer Science at UCLA. During his Senior year, he got a job in the UCLA Medical Center developing websites, building virtual worlds, and displaying medical data in 3d using VRML and Java. At that same time, he became obsessed with playing games and building levels for <i>Duke Nukem</i> and <i>Quake</i>. During late night hours, he built many popular single-player levels and worked with several Internet groups doing mods. His late night hobby turned into a career overnight when he accepted a job at Xatrix Entertainment, working on titles such as the <i>Redneck Rampage</i> series, <i>Quake 2</i> mission pack, and <i>Kingpin</i>. Upon joining Valve in 1999, Aaron returns home to the Northwest where he currently attends architecture and design classes in his spare time.<br>

								<b><a href="mailto:%20yahn@valvesoftware.com">Yahn Bernier</a></b><b> - Software Development Engineer</b><br>
								Yahn was an Atlanta patent lawyer with a degree in chemistry from Harvard. So obviously he ended up in Seattle developing computer games. He taught himself to program at the age of 12 and, more recently, developed what we at Valve have called &quot;that other level editor,&quot; <i>BSP</i>. Now that he's getting paid to make games, he figures he'll practice law in his spare time (little does he know). Yahn worked on <i>Half-Life</i>'s multiplayer code and is currently hard at work on <i>Team Fortress 2</i>. His favorite phrase, when imbibing too freely, is &quot;Yucca will assimilate you.&quot;<br>

These include in-circuit emulators (<i>CodeTap</i>), 3D surface reconstruction (<i>Surfgen</i>), 3D prosthetics design tools (<i>Shapemaker</i>), and satellite networking (Microsoft's Broadcast PC). He also wrote one of the first graphical shells for multiplayer online games for Compuserve's <i>Sniper</i>. Oddly enough, Ken has a BFA from Evergreen State University, where he studied painting, photography, and animation. Ken designed and implemented the skeletal animation system and many other engine components for <i>Half-Life</i>.<br>

A Ft. Walton Beach, Florida native, Charlie graduated from the University of Florida in the summer of 1994 and then headed for California and 3Dfx. His responsibilities there included developer support, ports of products to hardware, sample code and simple demos, and ultimately working with 3Dfx Developer Relations managing the engineering game porting effort. After a 2-year stint, Charlie left 3Dfx with college-friend Gary McTaggart to create the Uber(tm) Engine at Ritual Entertainment in Dallas, Texas. Shortly thereafter, Charlie and Gary left Ritual to start their own company. Valve subsequently contacted Charlie (and his friend Gary) with an offer &quot;they couldn't refuse.&quot;<br>

								Chia Chin has lived in Taipei, Paris, Johannesburg, Chicago, Madison (the one in Wisconsin), and now Seattle. Before joining Valve, he worked at Raven Software where he created audio content, designed dynamic sound systems, and performed various production roles as a team lead. As a film student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Chia Chin spent most of his time splicing together Musique Concr&egrave;te tape loops, making black and white short films a la David Lynch's <i>Eraserhead</i>, and playing computer games. Being obsessed with games and audio meant Chia Chin had no choice but to enter the software entertainment industry upon graduation. He is incessantly fantasizing about using audio, narrative devices, postmodern philosophy, and other pretentious techniques to enhance gameplay.<br>

Due to a clerical error, the program was promoted to Internal Development Manager at Sega Europe where it advanced to annoying Directors and Board Members. A variety of short, violent software management jobs in the USA led to its present installation at Valve, where its current goal is to lengthen build times beyond 24 hours, so that a 'daily build' is no longer possible.<br>
