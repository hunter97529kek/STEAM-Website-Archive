<h4>Hello there.  Remember us?</h4>
<font face="arial" size="2">
We&#146;ve emerged.<br><br>
It's been a long, long time since we've been in touch.  Too long. I know. <br><br>

It&#146;s all been for a good reason though.   Wedge and I have been through a lot in the past
year, and so far it's been something of a fairy tale.  <br><br>

For you folks who don&#146;t know, Wedge and I were just a  couple of guys who loved to play 
Quake and make Quake-c mods and one day :poof: we got yanked out of the rat race and 
thrown into the computer game industry. <br><br>

We&#146;ve been promising to tell our story for a while.  And now that Valve has made itself known 
and we get email from people wondering just what happened we figured we&#146;d
make good on that promise and go public, too. <br><br>

This web site will be temporary HQ for Wedge and I.  We&#146;ll try to spruce it up a bit more in 
the next few weeks. It is our hope that we&#146;ll fall into the habit of 
updating this site with new and interesting information on our work here at Valve, 
general rants and thoughts, and dastardly plans we plan to unleash in the <a href="http://www.owo.com/">Ultima Online </a>
world.  (We <b>WILL</b> make good on our promise to steal all the cheese in Britannia!) 
Who knows, maybe we can dust off a few of those old patches and get them into some kind of shape to release.
<br><br>

Onward..<br><br>

<b>Brief History:</b><br><br>

Once upon a time, in a state far, far away, Steve (Wedge) and I (Choryoth) were hard at 
work at an Internet Service Provider called Nucleus Communications.   Okay, that's a lie. 
We didn't do a damn bit of work.  How could we - we had a T1 connect to the Internet, 
speedy machines, and Quake.  It was a daily ritual to hand out beatdowns to high pinging 
bastards on quake servers everywhere.   (The folks at the Nucleus probably thought we 
were nuts to work the night shift all the time.)   One particular night, I was slaying 
folks as usual, but Wedge was scratching his head pouring over something he'd downloaded 
from id's ftp server.   I said, &quot;Foo, put that stuff away - join this server and help me
 murder people.&quot;  He didn't, of course.  He said, &quot;Carmack released qcc and the Quake-c 
source.  It might let us do some cool stuff to the game.&quot;  I thought it was a pretty big
 waste of time, and kept on minding my own, playing Quake for many, many hours, until he
 yanked me out of my chair to show me what he'd done.  I looked at his monitor and saw 
<a HREF="this.htm">this</a>. As my jaw hit the floor my mind reeled at the implications at what he&#146;d done
  - he had the power to <i>really</i> change Quake.  Sure, that was just a few nails stuck in 
the wall, but it showed more promise than anything we did hacking Doom, and with a little
 work we figured  we&#146;d have a huge spear that could sail through the air and pin foes to 
the wall.  We were hooked!  And so, that night, while Steve was furiously pouring thru 
pages of Quake-C, I was cranking out the first incarnation of our web site - Quake Command.  
We're fairly certain that we had the very first Quake-C web site - with a picture of that
 piddle group of nails stuck in a wall.  That night began the first of many sleepless 
nights, where we'd halfway write one patch, then realize it could be so much more, and 
move on to the next.   It was bad enough that we wasted most of our time playing in the
 world of Quake.  Now we wasted ALL of our time creating new worlds for Quake to play in.
<br><br>

The Quake Community was really beginning to boom around this time.  For us, every day was 
the same.  Wedge programmed constantly.  I&#146;d update Quake Command with our progress. 
Back then, getting a new model into Quake was an amazing feat, and simple mods like the
 <link> nail grenade, cheesy as it was,  caused quite a ripple thru the scene.  It was the
 age of discovery. Every day there was something new.. but the ritual was the same: 
Wake up, go to work, go home, play Quake. Wash, rinse, repeat.<br><br>

(I remember when some guy named Blue fancied himself a news guy and asked for a link off 
my page.  Sure, why not -  Mr. Wolf and Aftershock both went the way of all things -  maybe
 Blue would be the one to pick up the slack. Heh.) <a HREF="http://www.bluesnews.com/">

Within a very short time, which was actually, by the time distortion caused by Quake 
addiction, several months out of our lives, Wedge and I had released a handful of nifty
 patches - throwing axes, banana peels, a jetpack, and a few weapon enhancements like the 
flamethrower.  We&#146;d cut our teeth by then and begun an ambitious project we codenamed
 Capture The Flag (heh), but while planning and gathering opinions from the public we 
learned of some Zoid guy who was starting to do the same, so we abandoned it. We always 
wanted some kind of teamplay patch.  We&#146;re still big fans of Deathtag and Dogtag for Doom! 
 We experimented with a unique teamplay mod and created a playable version with four 
different player classes.  It was unique because there wasn&#146;t anything around like it - 
this was still the &#145;everyone doing more blood and faster shotgun&#146; era. You could climb 
walls with the assassin and mow people down with the heavy gunner machine gun.  Very 
primitive by today&#146;s quake mod standard, but ahead of it&#146;s time back in those days.  
We were proud, but soon got bored and took a break to start working on something we wanted 
to do since getting Quake-C - the Quake Aircraft.   It wasn't too long into this project
 before we stumbled upon many limitations of Quake-C.  Making the aircraft fly properly
 was a -huge- pain.  I remember spending several hours with Steve pulling out fistfulls
 of hair trying to understand why things didn't behave the way they should.  Eventually
 we'd muster up the courage to email John Carmack our pitiful questions.   &quot;Why can't
 we change bounding box shapes?&quot; &quot;Why don't our brushes clip properly?!&quot; He'd always 
set us straight, although sometimes the answer was, &quot;It's done that way for speed reasons. 
Wait for Quake 2!&quot;  We trudged on, released the Quake Aircraft beta, turned out a few more
 small patches requested by different people,  and begun work on a TC called Quake Kart!
    Quake Kart would capture all the fun from one of our favorite games, Mario Kart, 
but have lots of new cool crazy stuff and no stinky gorilla.  Anyway, we had it all
 planned out - players could zoom around levels in a pick-up truck that could be customized
 with items found around the track.  We had a gun rack for the truck.. stylish curtains 
for the rear window.. you could  have dogs in the back.. you could chuck a beer can out 
the window..   You could even pick up a buddy and have him ride shotgun or hang out in
 the truck bed and shoot up other drivers!  We had big plans for Quake Kart.  And with 
so many people emailing in suggestions it was bound to be a hit!  But during  the height 
of Quake Kart development is when Wedge and I dropped off the face of the earth.  It was 
because of this email:<br><br>

<blockquote>
<font COLOR="AAAAAA" size="2">
	Steve,<br>
	<br>
	Hi.  My name is Gabe Newell.  I am the managing director of a new games company
	here in Seattle called Valve.  I would like to speak to you, please give me a call.
	<br><br>
</font>
</blockquote>

Wedge and I had received several emails like this in the past.  Usually it was someone 
wanting to take what we&#146;d done and sell it on CD, have us relocate our web site so they 
could get hits, or make patches for a game they wanted to sell.  So when Gabe got around
to us we were tired of being pestered and hardly gave his email a second thought.  
I remember that night vividly. We were sitting in Wedge's room, buried under a pile of 
mountain dew cans, working on Quake Kart.  We were discussing Gabe&#146;s email because it 
was strange - most people that tried to put us to work droned on and on in email about
who they knew, how cool they were, how influential they were...  This one just said 
&quot;CALL ME.&quot;  And so I said, &quot;Well, call him.&quot;  And Steve said, &quot;Nah.  Why?  He&#146;s just
some punk.&quot;  I shrugged and  went home for the night. <br><br>

The next day is when the bomb dropped.  Steve did make the call after all,  and he found 
out it wasn&#146;t just another punk trying to exploit him.<br><br>

At the end of his telephone conversation with Gabe, Steve was booked to fly first class 
to Seattle, WA for a job interview at Valve.  He had reservations at a four star hotel,
 a rental car when he landed, and a handful of people to meet who wondered if he&#146;d like 
to make games for a living.  To say he pissed his pants is an understatement.<br><br>

It was such a tremendous shock because we never once thought what we were doing would 
actually get us anywhere in life.  We just wanted a cool Quake-C page.<br><br>

Apparently Steve did something right during the interviews and landed himself a job at 
Valve.<br><br>

About a week later I was given the same opportunity to come to Valve.  The whole process 
was very exciting, and very scary.   Once seeing Valve, what they were up to, meeting the
 people who work here, instantly having potentially a half dozen friends because everyone
 has the same thing in common - loving games - well, letting that slip through my fingers
 would have sucked.  Valve was everything we ever dreamed of.  What we did as an all 
consuming hobby paid off like we never expected.  We now get to spend our lives making and 
playing computer games.<br><br>

Well, that&#146;s the quick version.  I&#146;m going to try to dig up some old Quake Command stories 
and squeeze them in as appropriate.   We&#146;ve got this great digital camera here, too.. so 
maybe I can take a few shots around the company - particularly the Starbuck coffee house 
just down the sidewalk where I worship daily.<br><br>

 Steve and I will never forget the Quake Community for what it has done
 for us.  If it wasn&#146;t for id, Quake, and the encouragement of everyone out there during 
the time we had our site we&#146;d be.. ugh, I don&#146;t like to think about what we&#146;d be doing. 
 It probably would involve going to work on time.<br><br>

<b>Present Day:</b><br><br>

So what's up now? We're hard at work making <i><b>Half-Life!</i></b>  There's plenty of info and links to 
be had at the <a HREF="http://www.valvesoftware.com"><img SRC="pics/valvelogo.gif" border="0" align="center" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="31"></a> homepage.<br>
Half-Life is going to be a great game.  We'll definately be rambling on about it later.<br><br>
This whole past week we've been getting ready for E3. We're totally stoked about it - so if
you're going to be at E3, and you want to check out <i><b>Half-Life</i></b> email me at
<a HREF="mailto:choryoth@valvesoftware.com">choryoth@valvesoftware.com</a> and we can
arrange to hook up.  If you're gonna be at the Ritual e3 party, we'll see you there!<br>
<br>

Be back next week,<br><br>
