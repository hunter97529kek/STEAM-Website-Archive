			<p>With the plethora of multiplayer mods out that accept user made levels, making an excellent Half-life Deathmatch map remains one of the hardest things to achieve and, unfortunately, this map fails to impress, aesthetically and in terms of gameplay.<BR><BR>Visually, this map is extremely plain. It consists of a large, outside area, somewhat broken up into areas by walls and crates and a multistory building which seems to be some sort of crate factory. And therein lies the first problem with this map, as with so many first attempts before it: the only detail to break up the boxy architecture is crates. Lots of them. <BR><BR>The outside crate storage area (although some of the crates have things in them, I can only assume that with so many, the crates themselves are being stored) is unimaginative, to say the least. The lighting is entirely "middle of the day sunshine" and the ground is entirely flat. The sky is the default desert and, unfortunately, it is abused. It is never a good idea to let players see down the sky, since it looks terribly unattractive. Sadly, not only can you see down the sky, but one of the ladders actually lets you climb on to the walls, allowing you to walk up to the sky. This outside area could have been much improved with atmospheric lighting, sounds, a more natural-looking, uneven ground, coupled with a more substantial wall or cliff blocking the way to the sky.<BR><BR>Inside, the building is equally unattractive. Textures are inappropriate and badly aligned in places and no real theme or sense of continuity is established. Much of this map felt like it was a floor plan, and no architectural or texture detail had yet been added. <BR><BR>It is important for a map to make sense. This does not necessarily mean it has to be realistic. Half-life itself was not realistic but, within the setting it created, everything made sense and felt right, from the small details to the entire flow and structure. This map has several flaws,  such as a brick texture being used as a support for the ladder, what seems like a garden shed sunk into the bottom level of the building, light coming from invisible sources and ladders leading to rooms made out of crate textures, which ruin the illusion of a believable and satisfying environment in which to let your weapons do the talking. <BR><BR>The four levels in the building were all more or less identical and connected via ramps and a ladder. This requires a feat of jumping skill to get off at your desired level. These sorts of jumping tricks are possibly acceptable in a Single Player episode but in a deathmatch map they are simply ridiculous and are akin to sitting down and poking yourself in the belly with a pointy stick while other players use you for some light target practice. Only then the pain ends more quickly.<BR><BR>Technically, this map displays too many traits of a rookie designer. The r_speeds rose unacceptably high, 800 to 1000 and capping 1700. In the text file accompanying the map the author does say that the map may run slowly on slower machines. It will, but it also lags on almost any machine during net play.<BR><BR>The reason for these high r_speeds is clear. At several points, nearly the entire map is being drawn. To demonstrate this I took shot 8 with gl_wireframe set to 1 (the r_speeds are unreadable, they are around 1700 from that view point). As you can see, the building is being drawn right the way through, not helped by the vertical view provided by the gap in the floor, and nearly the whole outside area is visible. This needs to be fixed. As the windows play a rather small part in the gameplay, I suggest removing them; the roof provides adequate sniping areas as it is.<BR><BR>There are other technical problems. As can be seen in shot 4, decals are being used as textures. I doubt if the author wants this ugly effect. The correct way is to apply the decal with Worldcraft’s decal tool. More minor complaints include gfx.wad being used (it should not be loaded into Worldcraft at all), weapons shown stuck in walls and items falling out of world error messages. When investigating this, I came across the biggest technical fault of all; the entire map is built in a massive sky box (see shot 9). Not only will this mask leaks (by the warehouse exit there is a definite leak into the box) but it will also rack up HLVIS compiling time massively and adversely affect map performance. The correct way is to have only the outside area surrounded by a 5 brush sky box, with no bottom sky brush, to allow the bottom parts of the map to be outside the sky box and compiled normally. All this extra VIS information is the cause of the huge size of the .bsp file, 2.5 mbs unzipped is ridiculous for a map of this size.<BR><BR>Gameplay is stunted by a poor layout, mainly stemming from lack of connectivity. It’s a basic rule of deathmatch maps that all areas should have at least two ways in and out of them. This map ignores this rule, with only one entrance outside and one entrance to a section of the courtyard. The warehouse area is also poorly connected, with only one entrance but two exits. The connectivity is improved by teleporters, although a more coherent system would have been beneficial. As a result of this, gameplay is rather sporadic with isolated skirmishes and no central area to head for when you feel you have enough weapons to prove your totally superiority. Or otherwise.<BR><BR>On first observation the weapons seem far too readily available, with the RPG and other powerful weapons being available in several places in a not very large map. However, in practice the flawed layout and lack of flow means that you won’t be covering much distance between fighting and, if the weapons weren’t readily available, you would not get kitted out for serious violence for some time. All the weapons are available with a bit of hunting through areas not recommended for epileptics. <BR><BR>What needs to be done:<BR><BR><UL><li>Rethink of layout and architecture<BR><li>Fix technical errors<BR><li>Improve ambience<BR></UL><BR><p>

			<p><b>FINAL WORD</b><br />
			Although still in the beta testing stage, this map requires a massive amount of work on the areas mentioned above before a final release, and a good score.  Hopefully, this review highlights points that the author can use to improve this, and future, maps. Although showing a certain amount of promise, this map lacks in too many areas to be recommended in its current state.</p>
