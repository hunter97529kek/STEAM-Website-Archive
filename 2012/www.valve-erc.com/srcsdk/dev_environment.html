<h1>Setting Up the  SDK Development Environment
</h1>
<p>Before you can begin to compile and use the Source SDK, you'll need to setup an environment in which you can do so. The SDK relies on certain environment variables to be in place so that it may infer the location of files and content during the compilation of various assets. It also requires certain updates and upgrades to software packages you may be using for it to properly compile the binary components of the Source code.</p>
<h2><br>
Setting the VPROJECT Environment Variable</h2>
<p>The <span class="code2">VPROJECT</span> environment variable is used by many of the Source compilation tools to determine the ultimate destination or initial location of the assets it is dealing with. Failure to set this environment variable will result in failure to compile certain assets. The <span class="code2">VPROJECT</span> variable should point to the location of your MOD's game directory (i.e. &quot;C:\Projects\MyMod&quot;). This is also the directory in which the <span class="code2">gameinfo.txt</span> file resides for your MOD. To set the variable, follow the steps below:</p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="8"> 
<tr class="code"><td><p><b>WinXP</b></p></td></tr>
<tr class="codeLite"><td>
<ol>
  <li> Right-click on &quot;My Computer&quot; and choose &quot;Properties&quot;.<br></li><br>
  <li> Select the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab from the dialog.<br></li><br>
  <li>Select &quot;Environment Variables&quot; from this tab.<br></li><br>
  <li>Under the &quot;User Variables&quot; section, select &quot;New&quot;.<br></li><br>
  <li>In the dialog, under &quot;Variable Name&quot;, add the text: <span class="code2">VPROJECT<br>  </span></li><br>
  <li>In the &quot;Variable Value&quot; section, add the text: <span class="code2"><B>%sourcesdk%</B>\cstrike</span><br>
  <strong>Note: For this example the <span class="code2">VPROJECT</span> variable is pointing to the Counter-Strike game directory in Steam. <br>
  This value should point to whatever location your MOD <span class="code2">gameinfo.txt</span> file is located in (i.e. &quot;<span class="code2">C:\Projects\MyMod</span>&quot;, etc) <br>
  </strong></li><br>
  <li>Click &quot;Ok&quot; in all dialogs to close them.</li>
</ol>
</td></tr></table>
<br>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="8"> 
<tr class="code"><td><p><b>Command Prompt</b></p></td></tr>
<tr class="codeLite"><td>
<ol class="numberedlist">
  <li> Open a command line dialog.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Execute the following line: <span class="code2">set VPROJECT=&quot;C:\Projects\MyMod&quot; </span>(Note: The directory given should be the location of you MOD's <span class="code2">gameinfo.txt</span> file)<strong><br>
