<h1>Using SDK Sample Content </h1>


<h2>Sample Maps</h2>

<p>This release contains sample maps for <strong>Counter-Strike: Source</strong>, <strong>Half-Life 2</strong>, and <strong>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch </strong> levels.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some sample maps referred to in the documentation are not yet available. These maps will be available in the following release of the Source SDK.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Counter-Strike: Source Sample Maps </h3>

<p>The Counter-Strike sample maps are stored in a <span class="code2">sourcesdk_content\cstrike\mapsrc\</span>, underneath where you've installed <strong>Steam</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, if you've installed the <strong>Steam</strong> here, where <span class="code2">username</span> is your Steam login name:</p>
<p class="code">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\<em>username</em>\</p>

<p>The Counter-strike sample maps would be stored in:</p>

<p class="code">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\<em>username</em>\sourcesdk_content\cstrike\mapsrc\</p>

<p>To run a Counter-Strike: Source map you've built with the SDK release, see <a href="../Hammer/html/Running_Compiled_Maps.html">Running Compiled Maps</a>.</p>

<h2>Sample materials</h2>

<p>There are sample materials in the SDK directory under <span class="code2">sourcesdk_content\cstrike\materialsrc</span>. To compile materials,
open a command prompt and type:</p>

<div class="code">
	"%sourcesdk%\bin\vtex" "%sourcesdk%\sourcesdk_content\cstrike\materialsrc\sample1\sample1"
</div>

<p>Then your compiled <span class="code2">.vmt</span> and .<span class="code2">vtf</span> files will be compiled to this folder:</p>

<p class="code">%sourcesdk%\..\counter-strike source\cstrike\materials</p>

<p>For detailed instructions on material creation, refer to <a href="../Materials/materials_creation.html">Creating Materials</a>.</p>
