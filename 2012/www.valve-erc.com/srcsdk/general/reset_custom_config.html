<h1>Resetting a Custom MOD Game Configuration</h1>

<p>If you wish to reset your game configuration, but you've created your own MOD using the &quot;<strong>Create a MOD</strong>&quot; wizard, follow these steps to merge your custom configuration with the default configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This step is only necessary if you wish to retain the game configurations for a MOD you have created.</p>

<p>The Source SDK game configurations are in the <span class="code2">gameconfig.txt</span> file. To retain custom MOD configurations while resetting all of the other settings to the default settings, follow these instructions.</p>

<h2>Resetting your game configuration</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Open the <strong>SDK Steam Launcher</strong> to make sure you have the latest updates.<br><br></li>
	<li>Open the <span class="code2">&lt;Steam Install Directory&gt;/SteamApps/<em>username</em>/sourcesdk/bin</span>" directory in an explorer window. <br><br></li>
	<li>Rename the <span class="code2">&quot;GameConfig.txt&quot;</span> to <span class="code2">&quot;GameConfig_old.txt</span>.&quot;<br>
<br></li>
	<li>Choose &quot;<strong>Reset Game Configurations</strong>&quot; from the SDK Launcher.<br><br></li>
	<li>Open <span class="code2">GameConfig_old.txt</span> in a text editor, such as notepad.<br><br></li>
	<li>Find the configuration block for your custom game in <span class="code2">GameConfig_old.txt</span>.<br><br></li>
	<li>Highlight the configuration block for your custom game. Make sure to select the proper { and } characters for the selected configuration block. <br>
	<br>

	<li>choose <strong>Copy</strong> from the <strong>Edit Menu</strong>.<br><br></li>
	<li>Open <span class="code2">GameConfig.txt</span>.<br><br></li>
	<li>Place your cursor after one of the default configuration blocks and choose <strong>Paste</strong> from the <strong>Edit Menu. </strong><br><br></li>
	<li>Save the file.<br><br></li>
	<li>Click on <strong>Current Game</strong> in the <strong>SDK Launcher</strong> to make sure your MOD configuration appears. <br><br></li>
	<li>Repeat steps 5 through 12 for each custom configuration you may have, if any. </li>
</ol>

<p>If your configuration doesn't appear in the <strong>Current Game</strong> list, you probably pasted the configuration block into an invalid location in <span class="code2">GameConfig.txt</span>. Re-open <span class="code2">GameConfig.txt</span> and check to make sure your configuration is properly placed within the { and } characters. Look at the default configurations as a guide to where to properly place the configuration block. </p>
