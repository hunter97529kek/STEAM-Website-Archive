<h1>New Features of Source</h1>

<p>
There are a number of new features and capabilities of the Source engine which 
the Half-Life 1 mapper may wish to take advantage of.  This is not intended as
a complete list of all new features, but should be enough to get you interested
in exploring some of the new capabilities of the Source engine.
</p>

Mapping for Half-Life 1 Mappers</a>.

<h2>Fire and Smoke</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are two new entities which are excellent for creating fire and smoke
effects.  They are <span class=code2>env_fire</span> and <span class=code2>env_smoke</span>.
They should be pretty self explanatory to use and create.  If you aren't sure of what 
values to set, just use the default values you get when creating a new instance of these
entities in Hammer.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Steam and Fog</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
To give your map fog, place an <span class=code2>env_fog_controller</span> entity in the
map.  Setting it's parameters control how "thick" the fog is in your map.
</p>
<p>
To create a steam jet (like you'd have in a broken pipe), create an <span class=code2>env_steam</span>
entity.  Point it the direction you want the steam jet to go, and trigger it to create a blast of steam.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Rain and Snow</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
To create rain or snow, place a <span class=code2>func_precipitation</span> brush entity
covering the area where you want to have precipitation.  Set it's attributes to 
the density and type of precipitation you want.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Ropes and Wires</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
To create hanging wires and ropes in your map (such as power lines), place a 
<span class=code2>move_rope</span> entity at both ends of where the line should be.
Give one of them a name, and set the "Next Keyframe" value in the other to this name.  
You should see a line representing the wire/rope in Hammer's 3d view.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dust and Splashes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
To create a floating dust mote effect, make a <span class=code2>func_dustmotes</span> 
brush entity.  The space in the entity will be filled with small floating dust motes.  Very effective
where you are simulating sunlight shining in a window for example.
</p>
<p>
To make a splash happen in water, place a <span class=code2>env_splash</span> point
entity over the water surface where you want the splash to happen.  When triggered, the
entity creates a "splash" effect on the water's surface.
</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Physics Objects</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you want to make a brush based object be a "physics" object, make it a 
<span class=code2>func_physbox</span>.
</p>
