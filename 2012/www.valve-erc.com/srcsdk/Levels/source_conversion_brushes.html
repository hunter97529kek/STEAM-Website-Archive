<h1>Converting Brushwork</h1>
<p>
This section will help you out with converting brushwork in your old Half-Life 1
map to the Source engine, or help you get started with Source based mapping if 
you are familiar with Half-Life 1 mapping.  
</p>

<p>
For more reading on other aspects of map conversion, see <a href='source_conversion.html'>Source
Mapping for Half-Life 1 Mappers</a>.
</p>

<h2>World Brushes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
All your world brushes should be fine without any changes.  
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Basic Brush Entities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Let's start with the two core brush entities you're probably familiar with in
Half-Life 1:  <span class=code2>func_wall</span> and <span class=code2>func_illusionary</span>.
</p>

<h3>func_wall</h3>
<p>
In a nutshell, if the 
<span class=code2>func_wall</span>
doesn't have a name or any kind of special rendering property, 
just convert it to a 
<span class=code2>func_detail</span>. The <span class=code2>func_detail</span>
entity is new in Source.  It is basically a <span class=code2>func_wall</span>
which has no special render properties or any other properties.  Like any
brush entity, they do not block visibility.

There is one exception about <span class=code2>func_detail</span>
and render modes.  If you are using a Half-Life 1 rendermode SOLID
(an old "{" texture) 
then go ahead and convert the brush to a
<span class=code2>func_detail</span>.
It will automatically be rendered as it should be.  
</p>

<p>
If you have func_wall entities with names because you are targeting them
with an <span class=code2>env_render</span> for example, make the
brush a <span class=code2>func_brush</span>.  Because you are probably
doing something a bit more complex, you may wish to explore the new
capabilities of Source and find some other way to get the same
effect you are using.
</p>

<h3>func_illusionary</h3>
<p>
These haven't changed in Source, so you should be able to just leave your 
existing ones as-is.:w
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Rotating Doors and Other Entities with Origins</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
In Source, you no longer need to place an <span class=code2>ORIGIN</span> texture brush 
tied to brush entitys needing an origin.  Instead, all brush entities now have an origin
<i>point</i> associated with them.  You can see the origin point as a small "+" symbol
on the brush in Hammer's 2d views.  To move the origin, click on the "+" and drag it to a new location.  
You may want to zoom in a bit to better be able to select the point.
Place this origin point where you want the rotation axis to be for your object.  So if you have a brush based
<span class=code2>func_door_rotating</span>, put the origin on the side of the door 
you want it to rotate about.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Trigger Brush Entities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Brush based trigger entities the remain the same as in Half-Life 1, with a few 
difference.  There is still a <span class=code2>trigger_once</span> and 
<span class=code2>trigger_multiple</span> entity in Source.

When converting, texture all your trigger entities with the new <span class=code2>tools/toolstrigger</span>.

The bigges change with triggers is how trigger entities target things.  Targeting entities in
Source is rather different than in Half-Life 1, but much more powerful and useful to the
mapper.  
For more information on targeting and triggering, see 
<a href='source_conversion_entities.html'>Converting Entities</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Ladders</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you have any <span class=code2>func_ladder</span> entities in your map, you should texture them
with the new <span class=code2>tools/toolsinvisibleladder</span> material.  Other than that, you won't
need to change anything.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Water</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you have water in your map (<span class=code2>func_water</span> or otherwise), 
convert all the brushes into world brushes.  Then texture them with a water texture from 
a Source.  Paint all the sides of the water brush not visible with <span class=code2>tools/toolsnodraw</span>
material.  There are a few special rules for using water in maps, which are covered
in <a href='water.html'>Adding Water to a Level</a>.
</p>

<p>
One warning:  you can't make water brushes anything but horizontal in Source.  
So if you've got water brushes at an angle, you are out of luck.  You'll have 
to find some other way to create the effect you want.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Special Materials and Textures</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are a few new materials available in Source which you will want to get familiar with.
Below is a list of basic materials you may be familiar with that you need to convert.  There
are additional special materials available in Source however we're only covering the ones
with equivalents in Half-Life 1.
</p>

<h3>tools/toolsclip</h3>
<p>
This is the same clip texture you are used to in Half-Life 1.  It has the same behaviour
as you are used to.  Replace all your old <span class=code2>CLIP</span> textures with
<span class=code2>tools/toolsclip</span>.
</p>

<h3>tools/toolsnodraw</h3>
<p>
If you are familiar with the NULL texture from Half-Life 1 mapping, then you will
understand this new material.  Basically, any face textured with this new material
will not be drawn.  It can be used to texture faces of brushes you know the player will
never see.  Since nothing is drawn on these faces, they won't add to the load
on the engine to draw them.
Replace all your old <span class=code2>NULL</span> textures with
using the old <span class=code2>SKY</span> texture to create textures that 
don't draw, also replace it with <span class=code2>tools/toolsnodraw</span>.
</p>

<h3>tools/toolsskybox</h3>
<p>
This is the same as the old <span class=2>SKY</span> texture.  Replace all your 
<span class=code2>SKY</span> texture with the new 
<span class=code2>tools/toolsskybox</span> material.
</p>
