<h1>Making levels for Counter-Strike: Source</h1>

<p>This document describes the basics entities needed to make levels for Counter-Strike: Source. It assumes you already have knowledge of basic Hammer functions and CS:S gameplay. See the <a href="../Hammer/index.html">Hammer User's Guide</a> for information on basic Hammer functions such as geometry creation and entity placement.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, ladders can be created using the <span class="code2">tools/toolsinvisibleladder </span>material. In this case, simply assign the <span class="code2">toolsinvisibleladder</span> material to all sides of the brush. This makes an invisible ladder surface, and usually used in conjunction with a prop (model) ladder. </p></td>

Hold down CTRL to for additional faces, then click the Pick&#8230; button again when you're done.</p></td>

<a name="CSRoundResets"></a><h2>Counter-Strike Round Restarts</h2>

<p>At the end of each Counter-Strike: Source gameplay round, when end-of-round game conditions are met, the game resets itself for the next round. When this happens, most of the entities in the map reset to their original state, just as if the map was just loaded. However, the following list of entities are <em>not</em> reset, and continue in the same state in the all consecutive rounds:</p>
<ul class="code2">
	<li>env_soundscape</li>
	<li>env_soundscape_proxy</li>
	<li>env_soundscape_triggerable</li>
	<li>env_sprite</li>
	<li>env_sun</li>
	<li>env_wind</li>
	<li>env_fog_controller</li>
	<li>func_brush</li>
	<li>func_wall</li>
	<li>func_buyzone</li>
	<li>func_illusionary</li>
	<li>func_hostage_rescue</li>
	<li>func_bomb_target</li>
	<li>infodecal</li>
	<li>info_projecteddecal</li>
	<li>info_node</li>
	<li>info_target</li>
	<li>info_node_hint</li>
	<li>info_player_counterterrorist</li>
	<li>info_player_terrorist</li>
	<li>keyframe_rope</li>
	<li>move_rope</li>
	<li>info_ladder</li>
	<li>point_viewcontrol</li>
	<li>shadow_control</li>
	<li>sky_camera</li>
	<li>trigger_soundscape</li>
	<li>worldspawn</li>
</ul>
<p>All other entities are reset to their original state at the beginning of the next round, and all pending outputs are cancelled.</p>
<p>You can use a <span class="code2">logic_auto</span> point entity to trigger additional events to occur at the start of the  round. The <span class="code2">OnMapSpawn</span> output of the <span class="code2">logic_auto</span> will be fired when the map is first loaded, and at the beginning of the each round thereafter, after the reset. For example, in the map cs_havana, at the start of each round, a <span class="code2">logic_auto</span> has an <span class="code2">OnMapSpawn </span>output to a <span class="code2">logic_case</span> entity that randomly sets the routes open to the players each round. The <span class="code2">logic_case</span> enables and disables a series of <span class="code2">func_wall</span> brush entities that determines which routes are open and closed. For more information on how to use outputs, see <a href="entityio.html">Entity I/O</a>. </p>
