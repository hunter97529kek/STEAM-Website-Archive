<h1>Toolbars: Selection Mode</h1>


<p>The <b>Selection Mode </b>toolbar is used to determine how <a href="Grouping_and_VisGrouping.html">groups</a> and <a href="Creating_Entities.html">solid entities</a> will affect the selecting of objects.</p>
<p><img src="../images/interface/Toolbars_Selection_Mode.png"></p>

<p>The Selection Mode tool allows you to switch between the following modes:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Groups</b> - In this mode, clicking or selecting an object that is contained in a group or solid entity will also select all objects in that group or entity. It has no effect on the behavior of VisGrouped objects. See <a href="Grouping_and_VisGrouping.html">Grouping and VisGrouping</a> for more information on how to place objects in groups. <BR>
	<li><b>Objects</b> - In this mode, clicking on an single object contained in a group will only select the object. The group will not be used. However, if it's a brush contained in a solid entity, the entire entity will be selected. <BR>
	<li><b>Solids</b> - In this mode, all groups and solid entities will be ignored. Clicking on a brush that is contained in a solid entity will only select the brush. The rest of the entity will remain unselected. Note that this is the same as using the <a href="Toolbar_Map_Operations.html#GroupIgnore">Toggle Ignore Groups</a> on the Map Operations toolbar.<BR>
	<li><b>Zoom size</b> - If a 2D view is currently in focus, it's current zoom level will be shown.<BR>
	<li><b>Grid information</b> - The last box displays the current state of the grid options. &quot;Snap: On Grid: 64 &quot;. This means that <a href="Menu_Map.html#SnapToGrid">Snap To Grid</a> is enabled and the current <a href="Menu_Map.html#GridSettings">Grid Setting</a> is set to 64 unit increments.<BR>
	<li><strong>Size information</strong> - While creating new objects with the <a href="Tool_Block.htm">Block Tool</a>, the <b>Status Bar</b> will show the dimensions of the object that is being created.<br>
</ul>
