<h1>Dialogs: Check For Problems</h1>


<h3>Check for problems&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortcut: ALT+P</h3>

<p>Opening this dialog will cause Hammer to run through your map and notify you of any errors it finds.</p>
<p><img src="../images/interface/Check_For_Problems.png"></p>
<p>When you select one of the errors, the entity/solid will be highlighted (if applicable) and three options become available to you.</p>
  
<h3>Go to error</h3>

<p><span>This button will center the 2D windows on the selected error object.</span></p>
  
<h3>Fix</h3>

<p>This button will attempt to fix the currently selected error.</p>
  
<h3>Fix all (of type)</h3>

<p>Selected this button will fix all errors of the selected type.</p>

<p class=callout><b>Note: </b>The <b>Check for Problems</b> command looks for errors in  unmodified, supported game types (Half-Life 2 , Counter-Strike, etc). If you are creating maps for a proprietary game with your own game code and .FGD, some or all of the errors generated by this command may not be applicable.</p>
  
<h3>Some common errors that may occur in your maps...</h3>

  <p class=Code>Invalid solid structure</p>
<p>The solid has invalid structure, probably as a result of vertex manipulation. What this means is that the solid is not convex in every plane. You will need to either fix it, or if this is not possible, rebuild it.</p>
  <p class=Code>Solid Entity (entity_name) is empty.</p>
<p>This solid-entity contains no solids. Fixing the error deletes the entity.</p>
  <p class=Code>Entity (entity_name) has unused keyvalues.</p>
<p>The entity contains keyvalues (variables) that are not used in its class. You can fix this error with the Fix button. Note that this error will pop up if you are taking advantage of custom compile tools which add keyvalues to entities, but you are not using an FGD file that has these special keyvalues listed.</p>
  <p class=Code>There is no player start.</p>
<p>There is no <i>info_player_start</i> entity in the map, or the start point was embedded in a solid object. This error could also occur if you are using the <b>Edit Cordon Bounds</b> tool, and the player start entity was not inside the cordon area marked. If no player start point was created, use the <b>Entity Tool</b> to create one.</p>
