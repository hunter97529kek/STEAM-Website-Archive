<h1>Running Compiled Maps</h1>


<p>There is a known issue on some user's systems of Hammer not being able to run the game properly after compiling a map. If you're experiencing this problem, check the <strong>don't run the game after compiling</strong> flag in the <a href="Run_Map.html">Run Map</a> dialog.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to run your compiled map after you've compiled it in Hammer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compile your map with the <a href="Run_Map.html">Run Map</a> feature in Hammer. Make sure <strong>don't run the game after compiling</strong> is checked.<br><br></li>

<li>Using Windows, copy your map from the <span class="code2">\sourcesdk</span> directory to <span class="code2">\maps</span> directory of the game you're making the map for. Here are example locations for each of the core Steam games. Substitute &quot;<span class="code2">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam</span>&quot; for the directory where you installed Steam:
<blockquote>
<hr noshade size="1">

<p>For example, for <strong>Counter-Strike: Source</strong>, if your map is located here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="code2">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\<em>username</em>\sourcesdk\cstrike_sample_content\maps</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copy it to here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="code2">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\<em>username</em>\counter-strike source\cstrike\maps</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where <em>username</em> is your Steam login name. </p>

<hr noshade size="1">

<p>For <strong>Half-Life 2 </strong>, if your map is located here:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="code2">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\<em>username</em>\sourcesdk\sdkcontent\maps</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copy it to here:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="code2">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\<em>username</em>\half-life 2\hl2\maps</p>
</blockquote>

<hr noshade size="1">

<p>For <strong>Half-Life 2: Deathmatch</strong>, if your map is located here:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="code2">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\<em>username</em>\sourcesdk\hl2mp_sample_content\maps</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copy it to here:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="code2">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\username\half-life 2 deathmatch\hl2mp\maps</p>
</blockquote>

<hr noshade size="1">

</blockquote>
</li>

<li>Run <strong>Counter-Strike: Source</strong>, <strong>Half-Life 2</strong>, or <strong>Half-Life 2 Deathmatch</strong> via the Steam menu, depending upon which game the map has been created for.<br>
    <br></li>
<li>Open the <a href="../../console/developer_console.html">Developer Console</a> and type:<br>
    <br>
		
		<span class="code"> map &lt;mapname&gt;</span><br><br></li>

<li>Your map should load in the game.<br></li>
</ol>
