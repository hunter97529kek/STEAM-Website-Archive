<h1>Dialogs: Arch Properties</h1>


<p>The <strong>Arch </strong>primitive allows you to make complicated curved arches or circular staircases simply and quickly. The graphic preview gives an approximation of how the final arch will look with the settings chosen.</p>

<h3>Preview</h3>

<p><span>This button will redraw the graphic preview of the arch using the current settings.</span></p>
  
<h3>Wall width</h3>

<p><span>This is the width of the individual pieces of the arch. You can extend the arch walls outward by using a negative value here.</span></p>
  
<h3>Number of sides</h3>

<p><span>You can enter a value here between 3 and 100.</span></p>
  
<h3>Arc</h3>

<p><span>This is the number of degrees the arch will span. You can enter a value here that is between 8 and 360.</span></p>
  
<h3>Circle</h3>

<p><span>This button sets the <b>Arc </b>field to 360, which will generate a circular arch.</span></p>
  
<h3>Start Angle</h3>

<p>This lets you adjust the angle of the arch pieces, by setting the degree that the first piece is created:</p>

<h3>Add Height</h3>

<p><span>This allows you to make a stepped arch (like a circular stairway). Positive values create steps upward, and negative values downward. The steps increase or decrease in a clockwise manner:.</span></p>
