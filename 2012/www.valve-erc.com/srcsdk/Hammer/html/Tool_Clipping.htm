<p>The <b>Clipping Tool</b> allows you to slice the currently selected brush using <em>clip planes</em>. Clip planes enable you to precisely make a cut in a solid, leaving you the option to keep either or both parts of the resulting two solids. It is in some ways quicker and more efficient than carving or vertex manipulation. You have the option of only splitting the brush, or actually slicing a piece right off.</p>

<p>To use the <strong>Clipping Tool</strong> to slice an object with a clip plane:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the object to be clipped using the <strong>Selection Tool</strong>.<br>
	<li>Select the <strong>Clipping Tool</strong> on the <strong>MapTools</strong> toolbar.<br>
	<li>Drag a line across the selected object. This is the clip line. The part of the object to be kept will be highlighted in thick white lines. Cycle through the clip modes by clicking on the <strong>Clipping Tool</strong> icon.<br>
	<li>When you are satisfied with the potential resulting object, press the ENTER key to perform the clip.<br>
</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> You can cycle through the clip modes by clicking on the <strong>Clipping Tool</strong> icon, or by pressing SHIFT+X (fig.2, 3, 4). You can move both points of the clip line by holding CTRL and dragging one point of it.</p>
