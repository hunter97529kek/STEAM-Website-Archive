<h1>Dialogs: Prefab Factory</h1>

<p><span>This <b>Prefab Factory</b> allows for creation and maintenance of Hammer's prefab files. </span></p>

<p><img src="../images/interface/Prefab_Factory.png"></p>

<p><span>Much like the <a href="Entity_Report.html">Entity Report</a> dialog lets you manage entities, the <strong>Prefab Factory</strong> allows you to easily manage your collection of <a href="Creating_and_Using_Prefabs.html">prefab libraries</a>, including adding and deleting objects and editing existing prefab objects.</span></p>
  
<h3>Select a Library</h3>

<p>This allows you to select the library you want to work on at the moment. The three buttons to the right work directly on the selected library. <b>Add Library</b> creates a new empty library. <b>Remove</b> deletes the library from your hard drive. <b>Edit</b> allows you to edit the name and description of the library. The description of the currently selected library is displayed under the library selection box.</p>

<h3>Objects in library</h3>

<p>This displays the objects available in the currently selected library and allows you to work on them using the four buttons to the right. <b>Add object</b> brings up a browse box and lets you pick from files to add to the library as prefab objects. <b>Remove</b> deletes the selected object from the library. <b>Edit</b> allows you to edit the name, description and the map data of the currently selected object. <b>Export object</b> will let you export the currently selected object as a .MAP file.</p>
<p><span>When you select an object, its description, if any, will be displayed in the <b>Object Notes</b> section.</span></p>
