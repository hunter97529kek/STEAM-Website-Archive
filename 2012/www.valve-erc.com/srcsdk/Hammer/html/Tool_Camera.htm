		<p>The <b>Camera Tool</b> allows you to place and modify cameras within your level. While in camera mode, hold SHIFT and left-click and drag in any 2D view to create the camera. A line with a dot (the view point) will be drawn in the 2D views. You can adjust it until it is pointing in the direction you'd like by Left-clicking and dragging on the dot to reposition the camera viewpoint. Click and drag at the end of the line to move the target that the camera is looking towards. Hold down the CTRL key to move the both camera points simultaneously. To place more than one camera in a level, repeat the above steps.</p>
		
		<p>Cameras are good for helping you visualize the creation of your level. They are especially useful when using the <a href="Tool_VertexEdit.htm">Vertex Tool</a> as they allow you to see exactly what you are doing to a brush. You will also find multiple cameras especially useful if you are working on several areas of a level at once. Placing a new camera in an area negates the need to search for that area when you want to work on it again.</p>
