<h1>Creating and Using Prefabs</h1>

  <p>Prefab libraries allow you to easily store pieces from your levels that can be used over and over. Examples of useful prefabs include hallways, pillars, special entity setups, etc.</p>

<h3>Creating Prefabs</h3>
<p>Prefabs are simply small map (.VMF) files that contain only the prefab data. These prefab files are stored in a particular folder, the prefab folder, so that Hammer can find them and allow you to easily insert them into your levels.</p>
  <p>Prebs are created by selected the objects you wish to make into a prefab, and selecting the <a href="Menu_Tools.html#CreatePrefab">Create Prefab</a> command from the <strong>Tools Menu</strong>. Hammer opens a <strong>Save As...</strong> dialog open in the Hammer prefabs directory. Type in a name and click the <strong>Save</strong> button to add the prefab to the library. The prefab will now show up in the <a href="Toolbar_New_Objects.html">New Objects</a> toolbar, ready to placed into levels. </p>

<h3>Placing Prefabs</h3>
<p>Placing the objects you make is just as simple.</p>

  <p>In the <a href="Toolbar_New_Objects.html">New Objects</a> toolbar, select the library from the Categories list, select the object from the Objects list, and press the Insert original prefab button. The object will be inserted in your map, centered in the 2D views. For more information on placing prefabs, see <a href="Creating_Brushes.html#InsertingPrefabs">Inserting Prefabs</a> in <a href="Creating_Brushes.html">Creating Brushes</a>.</p>
