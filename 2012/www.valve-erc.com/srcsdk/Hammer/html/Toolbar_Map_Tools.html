<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-selection.png"> Selection Tool</h3>
<p>The <a href="Tool_Selection.htm">Selection Tool</a> allows you to accomplish a number of things. It is used to select, resize, rotate, shear, and move objects. </p>
  

<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-magnify.png"> Magnify Tool</h3>
<p>The <b>Magnify Tool</b> allows you to increase the magnification factor of the 2D views. Click once in a 2D view to increase the magnification level. Zoom back out again by clicking the right mouse button. Zoom in and out can also be accomplished by pressing the “+” and “-“ keys on the numeric keypad while the mouse cursor is in a 2D view. The mouse wheel can also be used to zoom in and out. </p>
  
<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-camera.png"> Camera Tool</h3>
<p>The <a href="Tool_Camera.htm">Camera Tool</a> allows you to place and modify cameras within your level. More information can also be found in <a href="3D_and_2D_Views.html">The 3D and 2D Views</a>.</p>
  
<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-entities.png"> Entity Tool</h3>
<p>The <a href="Tool_Entity.htm">Entity Tool</a> allows you to place point-based entities in a map. Point-based entities are those entities which exist only at a point, and do not rely on a brush for their effect. Also see <a href="Applying_Materials.html">Applying Materials to Solids</a>.</p>

<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-block.png"> Block Tool</h3>
<p>This is the basic creation tool in Hammer. The <a href="Tool_Block.htm">Block Tool</a> allows you to create any of the different types of primitive shapes and prefab objects in the <a href="Toolbar_New_Objects.html">New Objects</a> Bar. <span>Also see <a href="Creating_Brushes.html">Creating Brushes</a> for additional information.</span></p>

<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-faces.png"> Toggle Texture Application<a name="FaceEditTool"></a></h3>

<p>This button toggles the <b>Texture Application</b> mode on and off. <b>Texture Application</b> mode allows you to edit the properties of individual brush faces and create displacement surfaces. For more information, see <a href="Face_Edit_Mats.html">Face Edit</a> mode. </p>
  
<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-apply.png"> Apply Current Texture<a name="ApplyCurrent"></a></h3>

<p>When <b>Apply Current Texture </b>is pressed, the current texture selected in the <a href="Toolbar_Textures.html">Textures Bar</a> is applied to all faces of the selected brushes, replacing all textures existing on the objects. Texture scale and shift parameters are unchanged – the new textures will use the existing parameters on the objects.</p>
  
<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-decal.png"> Apply Decals</h3>
<p>The <a href="Tool_Decal.htm">Apply Decals</a> tool is used to place decals upon objects. A <i>decal</i> is a texture that can be placed <i>on top</i> of another texture, combining the two.</p>

<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-overlay.png" width="40" height="32"> Overlay Tool </h3>
<p>The <a href="Tool_Overlay.htm">Overlay Tool</a> is used to place overlays upon brush and displacement surfaces. An <em>overlay</em> is similar to a <a href="Tool_Decal.htm">decal</a>, but has some additional properties to control how the overlay is applied to the underlying surface.</p>

<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-clipping.png" width="40" height="32"> Clipping Tool</h3>
<p>The <a href="Tool_Clipping.htm">Clipping Tool</a> allows you to slice the currently selected brush using clip planes. Clip planes enable you to precisely make a cut in a solid, leaving you the option to keep either or both parts of the resulting two solids. Also see <a href="Reshaping_Solids.html">Reshaping Solids</a>.</p>

<h3><img src="../images/interface/mt-vertex.png"> Vertex Tool<a name="VertexEdit"></a></h3>
<p>Vertex manipulation gives you complete control over the shape of a solid object. Using the <a href="Tool_VertexEdit.htm">Vertex Tool</a>, you can reshape the object by manipulating individual vertices and brush edges, easily creating odd (and sometimes invalid) shapes. Also see <a href="Reshaping_Solids.html">Reshaping Solids</a>.</p>
