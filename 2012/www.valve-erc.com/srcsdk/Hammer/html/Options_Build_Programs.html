<h1>Options: Build Programs tab </h1>


<p><span>The <b>Build Programs tab</b> lets you specify all the executables for each game configuration to compile maps. These directories are used when running the <a href="Run_Map.html">Run Map</a> command. </span></p>

<p class=callout><span style='text-transform:uppercase'></span><b><span style='text-transform: uppercase'>Warning</span>:</b> If you plan to do your compiling from within Hammer, it is important that these settings are correct. You may not be able to perform a compile of the map if this information is incorrect.</p>
  
<h3>Configuration:</h3>
<p>Allows you to pick one of the preset game configuration profiles (Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Day of Deafeat, etc.), or custom profiles you’ve created, for which you wish to edit the properties. Game configurations are created in the <a href="Options_Game_Config.html">Game Configurations</a> tab. The information in the <b>Build Programs tab</b> reflects the currently selected configuration profile.</p>
  
<p>The Build Programs options allow you to setup configuration specific compile programs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Game executable</b>&nbsp;- This should be the Half-Life executable file (hl.exe). Simply browse to your Half-Life folder, select hl.exe, and press the Open button. The value entered here links to the $game_exe variable in the <a href="Run_Map_Expert.html">Advanced Compile</a> mode.<BR>
  <li><b>CSG executable</b> - The CSG program should be specified here, if one is needed for the current game configuration. The standard version is qcsg.exe. The value entered here links to the $csg_exe variable in the <a href="Run_Map_Expert.html">Advanced Compile</a> mode.<BR>
  <li><b>BSP executable</b> - As above, for the BSP program. The value entered here links to the $bsp_exe variable in the <a href="Run_Map_Expert.html">Advanced Compile</a> mode.<BR>
  <li><b>VIS executable</b>&nbsp;- As above, for the VIS program. The value entered here links to the $vis_exe variable in the <a href="Run_Map_Expert.html">Advanced Compile</a> mode.<BR>

<h3>Place compiled maps in this directory before running the game:</h3>
<p>This is the directory Hammer will copy the compiled map to once the it is complete. This is also sometimes called the .BSP directory. You can either type a the directory path, or use the Browse button to interactively select the directory. The value entered here links to the $bspdir variable in the <a href="Run_Map_Expert.html">Advanced Compile</a> mode. In the normal compile mode, this indicates where the compiled map will be placed.</p>
