<p>Visibility Groups, or VisGroups, are a way to group objects in layers to organize and manipulate them. The primary purpose for VisGroups is to hide pre-defined sets of objects for speed and organizational reasons. For more information on VisGroups, see <a href="Grouping_and_VisGrouping.html">Grouping and VisGrouping</a>.</p>
<h3>Place object in exisiting VisGroup:</h3>
<p>Displays a tree control listing of the VisGroups already defined in the current map. Click a VisGroup in the list to select it, and the selected objects will be placed in that VisGroup.</p>
<h3>Create new VisGroup:</h3>
<p>Click the radio button next to this option, then type in a VisGroup name in the accompanying text field. A new VisGroup with that name will be created, and the selected objects will be added to the VisGroup. </p>
<h3>Remove objecst from all other VisGroups</h3>
<p>Checking this box will remove the selected objects from all other VisGroups. They will only be included in the VisGroup selected in the dialog box.</p>
<h3>OK</h3>
<p>Closes the New VisGroup dialog box and applies the selected changes to the current selection.</p>
<h3>Cancel</h3>
<p>Closes the New VisGroup dialog box without making any changes to the current selection. </p>
