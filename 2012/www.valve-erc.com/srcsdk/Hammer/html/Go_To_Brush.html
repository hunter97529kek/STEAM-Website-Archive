<p>When you've got an invalid brush in your map, compile tools will give you the <em>brush id number </em>of the brush that is bad.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p class="code">Entity 0, Brush 4, Side 8: has a coplanar plane at (304, -384, 0), texture GENERIC99</p>

<p>To find the invalid brush in your map, you'd just bring up the Go To Brush dialog and enter 4 as the brush number, then press OK. The invalid brush will become selected and centered in the Views.</p>
