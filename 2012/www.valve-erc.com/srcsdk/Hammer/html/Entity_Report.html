<h1>Dialogs: Entity Report</h1>


<p>The Entity Report can be used to manage your entities and do quick searches for specific entities, providing an easy alternative to searching through your map manually.</p>

<h3>Entities</h3>

<p><span>This box lists the entities in your level based on what is specified in the Filter section. You can select a single entity, or multiple entities by SHIFT+clicking or CTRL+clicking. Selecting an entity in the Entity Report also selects it in the 2D and 3D views. With entities selected, you can use the buttons to the right: <b>Go to</b>, <b>Delete</b>, and <b>Properties</b>.</span></p>
  
<h3>Go to</h3>

<p>Centers the 3D and 2D views on the selected entities.</p>
  
<h3>Delete</h3>

<p>Deletes the selected entities.</p>
  
<h3>Properties</h3>

<p><span>Opens the <a href="Object_Properties.html">Object Properties</a> dialog for the selected entities.</span></p>
  
<h3>Filter</h3>

<p><span>Here you can specify filters so the only certain entities are displayed in the <b>Entity Report</b> list. You can choose whether all types of entities will be displayed, or only brush or point based entities. Hidden entities will be displayed if the <b>Include hidden objects</b> option is enabled.</span></p>
<p><span>When searching for a specific entity or group of entities, it will be convenient to use the search <b>By key/value </b>or search <b>By class</b>. While searching <b>By key/value</b>, entities with partial matches will be shown unless the <b>Exact</b> checkbox is checked.</span></p>
