<p>The <b>Smoothing Groups </b> dialog allows you to match sets of faces that will be lit as one smooth surface when compiled.</p>

<h3>About Smoothing Groups </h3>

<p>The Source Engine can add smoother lighting to faces so the surfaces appear as one continous surface. <strong>Smoothing Groups</strong> are sets of these faces that are defined  to render smooth with one another.</p>

<p>To be smoothed correctly, faces must meet these restrictions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Must share a common edge.</li>
	<li>Lightmaps of the faces must be aligned to one another.</li>
	<li>The <a href="Face_Edit_Mats.html#LightmapScale">lightmap scale</a> must be small enough that  at least one lightmap luxel is small enough to fit on each face.</li>
	<li>Must be in the same Smoothing Group. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Smooth</h3>

<p>These are the <strong>Smooth Group</strong>s that the current face(s) are a member of. To add a face to a <strong>Smoothing Group</strong>, select the face, then depress the numbered button of a Smoothing Group. A face can be in multiple <strong>Smoothing Groups</strong>. </p>
  
<h3>Hard</h3>

<p>Use these to pick a group of faces that will never be smoothed. <strong>Hard Groups</strong> are selected just like <strong>Smoothing Groups</strong>. For example, this can be used to make sure the ends of a cylinderical brush does not get smoothed with the side faces. </p>
