<p>This is the basic creation tool in Hammer. The <b>Block Tool</b> allows you to create any of the different types of primitive shapes, and to place prefab objects. Once selected, the <a href="Toolbar_New_Objects.html">New Objects</a> Bar will contain a list of objects from which to choose.</p>

<p>To create a primitive solid:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Select the <b>Block Tool</b>.<br>
	<li>In the <a href="Toolbar_New_Objects.html">New Objects</a> Bar, select the primitive shape in the <b>Objects</b> selection box. There are multiple options, such as Block, Wedge, and Cylinder.<br>
	<li>Drag a box in a 2D view, making sure it is the correct size and in the correct position in each of the views.<br>
	<li>Press Enter to create the solid.<br>
</ol>
