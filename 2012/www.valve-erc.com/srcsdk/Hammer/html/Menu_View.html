<h1>The View Menu</h1>

<p>The purpose of the functions in this menu is to control what does and doesn't appear in the Hammer Editor's 3D and 2D views. For more ways to customize the appearance of Hammer, refer to the sections on the <a href="Options_General.html">General Options</a>, <a href="Options_3D_Views.html">3D View Options</a>, and <a href="Options_2D_Views.html">2D Views Options</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="ScreenElements"></a>Screen Elements</h3>

<h3><a name="2DOptions"></a>2D Window Options</h3>

<p><span>The Hammer working area is divided into four separate panes. Three of these are used to show the 2D views. The forth window contains a single 3D view.</span></p>
<p><span>The items <b>2D XY</b>, <b>2D YZ</b>, and <b>2D XZ</b> are three commands to select which 2D view is displayed in which window. Click in a 2D window pane to select it, then choose one of the three options to choose which 2D direction is displayed in that window. The default window settings have one window from each direction.</span></p>

<p class=callout><b>Tip:</b> XY is the top-down view. YZ views from the side. XZ is the front.</p>

<h3><a name="3DOptions"></a>3D Window Options</h3>

<p>There are three 3D view options available – <b>Wireframe</b>, <b>Filled Polygons</b>, and <b>Textured Polygons</b>. These options control which 3D mode is used when the 3d preview window is shown. </p>

<p>Here is a cube drawn in each of the 3d modes:</p>
