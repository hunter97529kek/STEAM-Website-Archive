<h1>What's New in the Valve Hammer Editor?</h1>

<p>Major new features of the <strong>Valve Hammer Editor 4.0</strong> include:  </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Source Engine materials system</strong>. Materials created with the Source Engine's advanced shader-based texturing system are properly rendered inside the Hammer Editor. <BR>
    <li><strong>Displacement surfaces</strong>. A new class of mesh geometry that can be sculpted into different shapes and connected to one another to create terrain and other complex surfaces.<br>
	<li><strong>Input and Outputs entity system</strong>. Entities use a new method to trigger and connect to one another, offering a higher level of flexibility and control than ever before. <br>
	<li><strong>Hierarchical VisGroups</strong>. Objects can now be in multiple VisGroups, and Visgroups can be organized in a hierarchical manner for easier selection and organization.<br>
	<li><strong>Entity Helpers</strong>. New user interface controls that make editing parameters on entities such as spotlights and doors easier and clearer.<br>
	<li><strong>Per-face Lightmap controls</strong>. Lightmap density can be controlled on a per-face basis for more control over the balance of visual quality and rendering performance. <br>
	<li><strong>Sound Browser</strong>. Built-in browser to hear a preview of sounds available to level designers.<br>
	<li><strong>Non-modal Entity Report and Check for Problems dialogs</strong>. Dialogs are now non-modal, allowing for changes in the level and camera controls while using the information in the dialog boxes.<br>
	<li><strong>Smoothing Groups</strong>. Per-face control of lighting-based smoothing. <br>
	<li><strong>Find and Replace</strong>. Functions to both search and replace for text in any entity name, parameter, input, or output.<br>
	<li><strong>Selection Mode toolbar</strong>. A new toolbar to control the impact of groups and entities upon the selection tools. <BR>
    <li><strong>Overlays</strong>. A new type of texture entity, similar to decals, but with far greater control over how it is applied to surfaces. <br>
</ul>
