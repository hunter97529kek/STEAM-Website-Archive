<h1>Dialogs: Run Map - Normal Mode </h1>

<p><span>This command allows you to run the utilities that are necessary to <span>compile the map into the .BSP format usable in the Source engine</span>. The <b>Run Map</b> dialog will be in <b>Normal</b> or <b>Expert </b>mode, depending on which mode was last used.</span></p>
  
<h2>Normal Compile</h2>

<p><span>The <b>Normal</b> compile dialog gives you some very basic control over the compiling process, enough for simple testing of levels.</span></p>
<p><img src="../images/interface/Run_Map_Normal.png"></p>

<h3>Run BSP, Run VIS, Run RAD</h3>
<p>These settings allow you to define which tools will be run along with a couple of their most basic parameters.</p>

<h3>Save visible objects only</h3>
<p>If this option is checked, only objects that are not hidden will be compiled into the map.</p>

<h3>Don't run the game</h3>
<p>If this option is checked, the game will not be started after the map has finished compiling.</p>

<h3>Additional Game Parameters</h3>
<p>The text in the <b>Additional Game Parameters</b> text box will be appended to the game execution command, allowing you to feed special commands to the engine. If you are compiling a map for a mod, be sure to include the <span class="code2">-game &lt;modname&gt;</span> parameter. The parameters <span class="code2">-dev</span> and <span class="code2">-console</span>, also shown, are useful when testing maps. The BSP, VIS, and LIGHT processes are all dependent upon the <a href="Options_Build_Programs.html">Build Programs</a> settings in the <b>Options </b>dialog box.</p>
        
<h3>OK</h3>
<p>Starts the map compile with the current settings.</p>

<h3>Cancel</h3>
<p>Exits the <strong>Run Map </strong>dialog with no changes.</p>

<h3>Expert</h3>
<p>This button switches the <b>Run </b>dialog to <a href="Run_Map_Expert.html">Expert Compile</a><b> </b>mode.</p>
