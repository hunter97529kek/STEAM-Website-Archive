<h2><span>Working with .FGD files.</span></h2>

<p><span>The .FGD file is what Hammer uses to define its entities. It is a scripting language that sets up what entities will be available to you, what flags and keyvalues (variables) will be present in each entity, and what default values the flags and keyvalues will have. </span></p>

<p class=callout><span><b>Note:</b> Most Hammer Editor users will never need the information presented in this section. It is included here for those advanced users who are either customizing their .FGD file or are creating a new .FGD to add support for a new game or modification.</span></p>

<p>This section will contain documentation on the .FGD format and how to edit it.</p>
