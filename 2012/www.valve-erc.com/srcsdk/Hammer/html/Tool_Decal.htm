<p>The <b>Apply Decals</b> tool is used to place decals upon objects. A <i>decal</i> is a texture that can be placed <i>on top</i> of another texture, combining the two. Common examples include scorch marks or bullet holes. Use <b>Apply Decals</b> to place a decal in the 3D window. Each usage of <b>Apply Decals </b>creates a special decal entity that projects the decal texture onto other nearby solid surfaces. These decal entities can be moved around in the world, and will appear on any objects they cover.</p>
<p>Decal textures can be viewed and selected in the Textures window. Half-Life's decal textures are designated by the use of a “{” as the first character in the texture name. Decals are created by clicking on surfaces in the 3D view, and can be moved or deleted in the 2D views.</p>
