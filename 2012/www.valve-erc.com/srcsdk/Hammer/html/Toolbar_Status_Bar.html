<h1>Toolbars: Status Bar</h1>


<p>The <b>Status Bar </b>contains useful information about selected objects, as well as current zoom and grid levels.</p>
<p><img  src="../images/interface/Toolbars_Status_Bar.png" width="890" height="19"></p>

<p>The status bar contains a number of important pieces of information. Each bit of information has it's own little area on the bar. The areas are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Selection information</b> - The first piece of information on the status bar is about what is currently selected. If you've got a non-entity brush selected, you will see something like &quot;solid with 6 faces&quot;. If you've got an entity selected, the name of the entity and its type will be displayed, such as &quot;func_breakable&quot; or &quot;trigger_zombie_attack - trigger_multiple &quot;. In the second example &quot;trigger_zombie_attack&quot; is the targetname of the entity, and trigger_multiple is the entity class name.<BR>
	<li><b>Coordinates</b> - Following the selection information, The current map coordinates in units are displayed. These are the coordinates of the mouse cursor in whichever 2D view it's currently in. For example, &quot;@32, 144&quot; while the mouse cursor is in the Top View means the cursor is at X-coordinate 32 and Y-coordinate 144.<BR>
	<li><b>Selection size information</b> - When you select a brush or entity, it's size will be listed here. You'll see the width, length, and height values listed as something like &quot;32w 128l 64h&quot;, as well as the coordinates of the center of the selection. If you have multiple objects selected, their total size will be shown. <BR>
	<li><b>Zoom size</b> - If a 2D view is currently in focus, it's current zoom level will be shown.<BR>
	<li><b>Grid information</b> - The last box displays the current state of the grid options. &quot;Snap: On Grid: 64 &quot;. This means that <a href="Menu_Map.html#SnapToGrid">Snap To Grid</a> is enabled and the current <a href="Menu_Map.html#GridSettings">Grid Setting</a> is set to 64 unit increments.<BR>
	<li><strong>Size information</strong> - While creating new objects with the <a href="Tool_Block.htm">Block Tool</a>, the <b>Status Bar</b> will show the dimensions of the object that is being created.<br>
</ul>
