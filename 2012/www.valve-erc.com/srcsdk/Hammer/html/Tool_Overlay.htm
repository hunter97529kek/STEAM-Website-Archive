<p>The <b>Overlay</b> tool is used to place overlay objects onto brush or displacement surfaces. An <i>overlay</i> is a material that can be placed <i>on top</i> of another texture, combining the two. Overlays are similar to <a href="Tool_Decal.htm">Decals</a> but have additional properties that control how they are applied to surfaces. Also, unlike decals, overlays can be transformed with the <a href="Tool_Selection.htm">Selection Tool</a>, so they can be rotated and scaled.</p>

<p>To place an <strong>Overlay</strong>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Selection the <b>Overlay Tool</b> as the active tool.<br>
	<li> Click <strong>Browse</strong> on the <a href="Toolbar_Textures.html">Texture</a> toolbar and pick a material for the overlay from the <a href="Texture_Browser.html">Texture Browser</a>.<br>
	<li>Turn on <a href="Menu_View.html">3D Texture Polygons</a> mode, so you can see the texture you are placing the decal upon.<br>
	<li> Create the overlay by clicking in the <strong>3D View</strong> on the surface you wish to add the overlay onto.<br>
	<li>After the overlay is created, the four corner handles can be dragged to change the shape of the overlay.<br>
	<li>To rotate or scale the overlay, switch to the <a href="Tool_Selection.htm">Selection Tool</a> and transform it in one of the 2D Views.<br>
</ol>

<p class="callout"><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Overlay Tool</strong> must be selected to be able to edit the corner handles on an overlay.</p>

<p>When an overlay is placed, it creates an <em>info_overlay</em> entity. The <a href="Object_Properties.html">Object Properties</a> dialog for <em>info_overlay</em> has additional parameters that can be changed, including the material that is used.</p>
