<h1>Tools: Entity Tool</h1>

<p><span>This tool allows you to place point-based entities in a map. Point-based entities are those entities which exist only at a point, and do not rely on a brush for their effect. Once the <b>Entity Tool </b>is selected, the <a href="Toolbar_New_Objects.html">New Object</a> dialog will contain a list of entities from which to choose. Click on one of the 2D views and press Enter to place the entity. If <a href="Menu_Map.html#SnapToGrid">Snap To Grid</a> is enabled, the new entities will be snapped to the grid. </span></p>

<p class=callout><b>Note:</b> In order to place a brush-based entity (a <i>func_door</i> for example) you must first create the brush with the <a href="Tool_Block.htm">Block Tool</a>. See <a href="Menu_Tools.html#TieToEntity">Tie to Entity</a>, under the <b>Tools Menu</b>, for more information on brush-based entity creation.</p>

<p>See <a href="Creating_Entities.html">Creating Entities</a> for more information on creating both point and solid entity types. </p>
