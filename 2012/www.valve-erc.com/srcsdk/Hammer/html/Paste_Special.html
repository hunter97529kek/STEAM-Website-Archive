<h1>Dialogs: Paste Special </h1>

<p><span>Pastes a copy of any objects in the clipboard into the current file, using special placement information entered into the dialog box.</span></p>
<p><img src="../images/interface/Paste_Special.png"></p>

<p><span>This dialog allows multiple pasting of the clipboard contents with offsets and rotations. This relieves the work in creating an object that contains many identical elements. For instance, to create a picket fence you can make one rail, then copy it multiple times with on offset for each new rail.</span></p>
  
<h3>Number of copies to paste</h3>

<p><span>This value controls the number of new copies that will be created by the operation.</span></p>
  
<h3>Start at center of original</h3>

<p><span>In the default On position, offsets and rotations are relative to the location and rotation of the original item in the clipboard. With it off, the new objects will be created relative to the center of the two previously selected windows.</span></p>
  
<h3>Group copies</h3>

<p><span>Turning this on will group all resulting objects together. The default for <b>Group copies</b> is off.</span></p>
  
<h3>Offset (accumulative)</h3>

<p><span>The three boxes here allow offset values for X, Y and Z. With each additional paste, the next object will be offset from the previous one by these values which are given in map units. The '&lt;' buttons beside each box will automatically insert the current grid settings.</span></p>
  
<h3>Rotation (accumulative)</h3>

<p><span>These settings work in the same fashion as the Offset values, except that they apply rotation with each successive paste.</span></p>
