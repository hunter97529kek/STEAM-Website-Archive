<p>The <b>Make Hollow</b> dialog will ask you to supply a value for wall thickness. Positive numbers will create the walls outward, and negative numbers will hollow inward. Each of walls that are created as separate solid objects, and are grouped together as one. You can <b>Ungroup</b> them to select and edit them individually. Several objects can be selected to <b>Make Hollow</b> at once, and the command will make separate hollow groups out of each of them.</p>
