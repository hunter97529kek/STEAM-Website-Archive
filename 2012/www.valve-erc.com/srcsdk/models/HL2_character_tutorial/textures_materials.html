<h1>Character Textures And Materials</h1>

    <p class="para_indent">When you compile a model for the Source engine, the names of the texture files (.TGA files) are used to reference a material shader (.VMT) instead of the original image file. Here is an example of a simple .VMT file:</p>

<pre class="code">
"VertexLitGeneric"
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"$basetexture" "models/Humans/Female/naomi_facemap"
}
</pre>

    <p class="para_indent">This file simply specifies the shader type (<span class="code2">VertexLitGeneric</span>) and includes a link to the image source, which is in the compressed .VTF image format.</p>

    <p class="para_indent">When using the <strong>XSI Mod Tool</strong> to produce models that will run in the Source engine, place your textures into the Source SDK directories provided when you installed the SDK. See <a href="../../general/content_directory_structure.html">SDK Directory Structure</a> for more information on these directories.</p>

<p class="para_indent">Using this structure, you can refer to the .TGA files in the <span class="code2">materialsrc/models</span> tree when you texture the model in XSI. When you compile or load the model into the Source engine or tools, it will refer to the .VMT files in the <span class="code2">materials/models</span> tree.</p>

    <p class="para_indent">You can use the utility <span class="code2">vtex.exe</span> to convert .TGA files to our compressed .VTF format. For more information on how to create textures and use Vtex, see <a href="../../Materials/materials_creation.html">Creating Materials</a>. </p>
