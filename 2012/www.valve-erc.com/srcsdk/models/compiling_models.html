<h1>Compiling Models Basics</h1>


<h2>Exporting and Compiling Models</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to export a model from XSI and compile it with the Source SDK tools:</p>

<ol class="numberedlist">
<li>Export the SMD files somewhere under the SDK's <span class="code2">modelsrc</span> directory for the game you're compiling for.<br><br>
For example, for a Counter-Strike Source model:<br><br>
	<span class="code2">C:\Program Files\Valve\Steam\SteamApps\<em>username</em>\</span><span class="code2">sourcesdk_content\cstrike\modelsrc</span><br><br>
	Where <em>username</em> is your Steam Login name.</li><br><br>

<li>Create a .QC file in the same place as your .SMD files. You can refer
	to the QC files that are already in the <span class="code2">sourcesdk_content\cstrike\modelsrc</span> directory for examples. See <a href="modeling_qc_commands.htm">QC Commands</a> for a detailed list of commands you can use in .QC files.<br><br></li>


<li>Make sure you have the proper <strong>Current Game</strong> selected on the <strong>SDK Launcher</strong> panel (eg. Counter-Strike: Source). </li>
<br><br>
	
<li>Run <span class="code2">studiomdl.exe</span> on your .QC file. To do this, open a Windows command prompt, and type:
	
	
	<br><br><div class="code">
	cd "%sourcesdk%"<br>
	bin\studiomdl <span class="code2">..\sourcesdk_content\cstrike\modelsrc</span>\<em>mymodel.qc</em>
	</div>	

	<br>
	<strong>Note</strong>: This makes use of an environment variable called "sourcesdk" to simplify things. This environment variable
	is created upon installation of the Source SDK.<br>
	<br></li>

<li>If there are no errors with the .QC file or your .SMD files, then you will have a .MDL file in the location specified
by the <em>$modelname</em> key in the .QC file.<br><br></li>

<li>You can now run <strong>Model Viewer</strong> in the <strong>SDK launcher</strong> and open your model file.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Placing models</h2> 

<p>You can place a model with the Hammer level editor to see it inside the game.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This copying step will not be required in the full SDK release.</p>
<p>To place a compiled model in Hammer:</p>
	
	<ol class="numberedlist">
		
	    <li>Open the <strong>Hammer Editor</strong> from the <strong>SDK Launcher</strong>.</li><br><br>
		
	    <li>Add a prop entity with the <strong>Entity Tool </strong>(<span class="code2">prop_static, prop_dynamic</span> or <span class="code2">prop_physics_multiplayer</span>, depending on your model type). In the <strong>Object Properties</strong> for the entity, browse the model tree to view and place the model. See the <a href="http://collective.valve-erc.com/index.php?go=hammer_docs">Hammer documentation</a> for information on how to use the <strong>Entity Tool</strong>. </li>
	</ol>


<h2>Sample Models</h2>

<p>There are a number of Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 sample models in the <span class="code2">sourcesdk_content</span>  directory that you can refer to for examples. They are
compiled in the same way as models you create yourself. For example, you can type these commands at a command prompt to compile the lamp holder sample:<br><br> 

<div class="code">
	cd "%sourcesdk%"<br>
	bin\studiomdl <span class="code2">..\sourcesdk_content\cstrike\modelsrc</span>\lamp\it_lampholder1.qc
</div>
